If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else.‚Äù -- Yogi Berra (no, not Yogi Bear)

That's one of my favorite quotes, and as this is the first blog post on this website, I thought that I might follow Yogi Berra's advice, and state publicly what my goals are for this blog.

This blog is intended to be an outlet for some of the insights and creative projects that I'm exploring. I intend to use this blog to build in public (find out more about what that means here: buildinpublic.xyz), as well as to improve my skills in writing, story telling, and teaching.
