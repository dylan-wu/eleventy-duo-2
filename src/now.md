## Follow Me Into Math

Follow Me Into Math (FMIM) is an NSF funded research program to led by UTRGV professors in the Mathematics, and Education departments.

FMIM is focused on motivating interest and academic choices in mathematics through near-peer interactions. The idea is that when high school students are mentored by their near-peers, e.g. college students, they're engagement rate and interest is higher than if they were to be instructed by college professors and other teachers. I am one of 7 student research assistants who are participating in data collection, marketing, and mathematics presentations.
